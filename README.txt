Falcon 14 Demo
YouTube Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VoFhzON380&list=PLobv4epDs1Tyu-UTAMkzzNyLoT9-Fj7Z_&index=1

The following is a demo of our group's game, Mission Falcon 14. Mission Falcon 14 takes the player on a journey
through time to assist STEM pioneers from around the world. The demo begins where the player would chose their
first destination after speaking with their mentor, Elon Musk. The first pioneer is Albert Einstein located in
pre-WW2 Germany. After choosing their destination, the player is warpped to the pioneer's location. There, the
player will assist the pioneer by solving a puzzle associated with that pioneer's field (science, technology,
engineering, mathematics).

Once the player reaches the pioneer, he or she must search their room for clues as to how to assist them. Albert
Einstein's puzzle is a 2D memory puzzle, where the player must assemble physics formulas to solve the puzzle.
Once the puzzle is complete the puzzle is over and the player is returned to the main menu to allow other players
to play.

this project was assembled in Unity using 11 scripts and 12 asset packages.

All scripts were created by the group Nuka Cola. No scripts were downloaded, copied, or stolen in any way.
Scripts in order of importance:
PuzzleGameController.cs
FirstPersonController.cs
FirstPersonViewer.cs
MenuScript.cs
personInteract.cs

Cheatsheet
The following is a list of hidden objects, clues, and jokes in the demo. Intended for reading AFTER the demo
is thoroughly played. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in lack-of-fun or spoilers.
Here we go:
	- Asteroids in the main menu can eventually hit the player.
	- The music in the main menu is from Disney's Space Mountain in Magic Kingdom.
	- Each icon on the transponder map leads to a different destination.
	- The voice in the transponder scene is voiced by one of the group members.
	- The first desk spotted in the lab scene has two mushrooms on it, foreshadowing Einstein's creation
	  of the atomic bomb. Two atomic bombs, Little Boy and Fat Man, were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki
	  in WW2 leading to Japan's surrender and the conclusion of the largest global war in history.
	- There is a white kitten in the lab. He is your master...
	- The books in the lab are "spell books" representing Einstein being accused of witchcraft when he was
	  studying the universe.
	- Einstein used scrolls?
	- Even Einstein admires his most famous portrait.
	- Hover over Einstein a few times, he might have some more things to say.
	- If you haven't found it, click on the red book on Einstein's desk to go to the next level.
	- After you match an equation in the 2D memory game it will display the definition of that equation in
	  its corresponding color.
	- Whichever equation displayed last in the puzzle will display the final score in that color.
	- This project has 503 lines of code, 218 game objects, 21 buttons, 5 scenes, 3 visible skyboxes,
	  3.65GB of memory, and one white kitten.
